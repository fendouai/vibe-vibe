## Introduction

Technical documentation describes what a system is supposed to do, but the final implementation relies on code. You don't need to write every line of code yourself, but you do need to understand the basic logic of code—so you can read AI-generated code, know what it's doing, and troubleshoot when something goes wrong.

There are hundreds of programming languages, each with different syntax, but they all share a few common core concepts. Understanding these concepts is like learning the "alphabet" of reading code.

## The Four Basic Building Blocks of Code

<CodeConceptVisualizer />

When you ask AI to generate code, what it's essentially doing is combining four basic elements. Understanding these concepts will help you read code and know what it's doing.

### Variables: Containers for Data

A **variable** is a container for storing data. You can think of it as a labeled box—the data goes inside the box, and the label is the variable name.

For example, `let username = "张三"` creates a box called `username` with "张三" inside it. You can retrieve this value anytime later, or replace the contents of the box with something else.

Variables allow code to "remember" information. A user's login status, the items in a shopping cart, an article title—these are all pieces of data stored in variables.

### Functions: Reusable Blocks of Instructions

A **function** is a reusable block of instructions. When you find yourself writing similar code repeatedly, you should package it into a function.

A function takes input (parameters), performs an operation, and then returns output. For example, a function that calculates the total price of a product:

- Input: unit price, quantity
- Process: unit price × quantity
- Output: total price

Once a function is defined, whenever you need to calculate a total price, you can simply call that function with different parameters instead of rewriting the calculation logic.

### Conditions: Forks in the Road

A **condition** allows a program to take different actions depending on the situation.

```
if (用户已登录) {
  显示欢迎信息
} else {
  显示登录按钮
}
```

This is a conditional statement—the program decides which block of code to execute based on the condition "whether the user is logged in." It's like a fork in the road, where the program chooses which path to take based on a condition.

### Loops: The Power of Repetition

A **loop** allows a program to repeatedly perform certain operations.

For example, if you need to send emails to 1000 users, you don't need to write the send-email code 1000 times. You just write one loop: "for each user in the list, send an email."

The essence of a loop is: **use a short description to accomplish a large amount of repetitive work**.

## Turing Completeness: The Power of These Four Building Blocks

These four concepts—variables, functions, conditions, and loops—form the foundation of **Turing completeness**. This means that any computable problem can be solved using combinations of these four building blocks. Every app on your phone—calculator, WeChat, Taobao, Douyin—is built on different combinations of these four elements under the hood.

From simple calculators to complex artificial intelligence, from web forms to operating systems, everything underneath is built from different combinations of these four concepts.

When reading code, try to identify these four elements:

- Where is data stored? → **Variables**
- Where are operations encapsulated? → **Functions**
- What gets executed under what conditions? → **Conditions**
- What is being repeated? → **Loops**

## Pseudocode: A Bridge for Talking with AI

Once you understand the basic building blocks of code, you can read simple code logic. But more importantly, you can use these concepts to describe the functionality you want to AI—and that's what pseudocode is for.

**Pseudocode** is a way of expressing ideas that sits between natural language and formal code. It uses programming logic structures (such as conditions and loops) to describe requirements, but it doesn't need to follow any specific syntax.

For example, if you want AI to help you write a user login feature, you can describe it with pseudocode:

```
当用户点击登录按钮时：
    获取输入框中的邮箱和密码
    检查邮箱格式是否正确
    如果格式正确：
        发送请求到服务器验证
        如果验证成功：
            跳转到首页
        否则：
            显示"密码错误"
    否则：
        显示"邮箱格式不正确"
```

This way of describing requirements is clearer than plain natural language, while still not requiring you to master specific syntax. AI can understand pseudocode very well and help convert it into formal code.

## Algorithmic Thinking: Why the Same Functionality Can Have Different Code

When you describe requirements with pseudocode, AI may provide different implementation approaches. These approaches can all achieve the same functionality, but the steps may differ.

For example: finding a specific email address among 1000 users.

**Approach 1**: Check them one by one. In the worst case, you need to check all 1000.

**Approach 2**: If the users are sorted by email, start by checking the one in the middle. If the target email comes later, then you only need to check the second half, and repeat the process. This way, you need at most 10 checks.

Both approaches can complete the task, but the second one takes fewer steps. When asking AI to generate code, if large amounts of data are involved, you can simply remind it that "the data volume is large, please use an efficient search method"—AI will understand what you mean.

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ Variables are containers for storing data
- ✅ Functions are reusable units that encapsulate operations
- ✅ Conditions allow a program to branch its execution
- ✅ Loops allow a program to repeat execution
- ✅ Pseudocode is a tool for describing requirements using programming logic
- ✅ The same functionality can be implemented in different ways, and AI will choose an appropriate approach

Now that you've understood the basic building blocks of programming, next you'll learn the fundamentals of API and HTTP communication.
