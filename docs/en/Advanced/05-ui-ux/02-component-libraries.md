# 5.2 Component Libraries

> **Goal of this section**: Understand the characteristics and best use cases of mainstream component libraries, and learn how to choose the right one based on your project needs.

A component library is like a set of prebuilt "LEGO blocks." You don't need to hand-code buttons, input fields, or dialogs every single time—just use what's already built. As the veterans say: "Choose the right component library, and you'll save 80% of your UI work."

## shadcn/ui（Recommended）

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

It was already introduced in the preface, but here let's dive deeper into why it's the top choice for VibeCoding.

**Core idea**: It's not an npm package. Instead, the component source code is copied directly into your project. You have full control.

**Why it's great for AI development**:

With traditional component libraries, the code is buried deep inside `node_modules`, so AI can't see or modify it; with shadcn/ui, the code lives right in your project folder, so AI can edit it just like code you wrote yourself.

- The code lives in your project, so AI can read and modify it directly
- High-quality components with solid accessibility support—for example, visually impaired users using screen readers can still interact with buttons and forms normally
- A rich ecosystem with plenty of extension components and templates

**How to help AI use shadcn/ui well**:

Tell the AI that your project uses shadcn/ui, and it will prioritize using those components.

**shadcn/ui ecosystem extensions**:

The shadcn/ui ecosystem keeps growing, and the community has contributed many high-quality extensions:

| Extension Library | Use Case |
|-------|------|
| [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/) | Animated components, special effects components |
| [Aceternity](https://www.aceternity.com/) | Advanced UI effects components |

## Component Library Selection Decision Tree

<LibraryDecisionTree />

## Let AI Help You Use Component Libraries

No matter which component library you choose, the key is to **clearly tell the AI which one you're using** in your prompt:

> "Use the shadcn/ui Table component to display a user list with sorting and pagination"

> "Use Ant Design to build an order management table with filtering and export support"
