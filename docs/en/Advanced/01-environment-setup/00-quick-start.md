::: warning PowerShell execution policy error?

If you get the error "cannot load script because running scripts is disabled on this system" when running commands in PowerShell, start PowerShell as an administrator, then run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then rerun the command above.

## Mac/Linux Users {#mac-linux-users}

### 1. Install Git

**macOS**：

- The first time you type `git` in Terminal, you'll be prompted to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Just click Install.
- Or run it manually: `xcode-select --install`
- If you want the latest version, use Homebrew: `brew install git`

**Linux**：

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install git -y
```

### 2. Open Terminal

- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, then type "Terminal"
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

### 3. Run the Environment Initialization Script

This script will automatically install Node.js, pnpm, and configure a China mirror:

**macOS：**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cnb.cool/vibevibe/scripts/-/git/raw/main/init-node-mac.sh | sed 's/\r$//' | sh && npm install -g pnpm && pnpm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/ && pnpm setup
```

**Linux：**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cnb.cool/vibevibe/scripts/-/git/raw/main/init-node-linux.sh | sed 's/\r$//' | sh
```

After the script finishes, **please reopen the terminal window** (or run `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc`) to apply the configuration.

This script automatically sets up the following: **nvm** (Node Version Manager, used to switch between Node.js versions), **Node.js** (the JavaScript runtime used to execute TypeScript code), **pnpm** (a package manager that is faster and more space-efficient than npm), and **a China mirror** (configures the Taobao mirror to speed up dependency downloads).

### 3. Verify the Installation

```bash
git --version
node -v
```

If version numbers are displayed, the installation was successful.

### 4. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After the installation finishes, run:

```bash
claude
```

If you see the Claude Code welcome screen, the installation was successful!

## Configure the GLM Model {#config-glm}

Claude Code uses Anthropic's official Claude models by default, but you can also configure a domestic model such as GLM, which is more affordable and faster to access.

**Step 1: Get an API Key**

Visit the [Zhipu Open Platform](https://open.bigmodel.cn/), click the "Sign Up / Log In" button in the upper-right corner, and follow the prompts to complete account registration. After logging in, go to your personal center page, click [API Keys](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/proj-mgmt/apikeys), and create a new API Key.

![image-20260203181347764](/images/Advanced/image-20260203181347764.png)

![image-20260203181406471](/images/Advanced/image-20260203181406471.png)

**Step 2: One-click helper install - automatic configuration**

Run the following in Terminal/PowerShell:

```bash
npx @z_ai/coding-helper
```

![Description](/images/Advanced/1764741445765coding-tool-helper.gifattname=coding-tool-helper.gif)

Enter the API Key you obtained, and the tool will automatically complete all configuration steps.

**Step 3: Verify the Configuration**

```bash
claude
```

Claude Code will now use the GLM model to answer your questions.

::: tip Official documentation

For more configuration details, see [GLM Official Documentation - Claude Code Configuration Guide](https://docs.bigmodel.cn/cn/coding-plan/tool/claude).

:::

::: tip Need to manage multiple model providers?

If you need to frequently switch between different AI model providers (such as GLM, DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.), you can use [cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch) — a desktop GUI configuration management tool that supports Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. It lets you switch API configurations with one click, centrally manage MCP servers and Skills, and supports speed testing and quick switching from the system tray.

## About nvm (Optional) {#about-nvm}

The initialization script for Mac/Linux users automatically installs nvm (Node Version Manager). If Windows users want to manage multiple Node.js versions, you can install nvm:

![image-20260203181915052](/images/Advanced/image-20260203181915052.png)

**Download** link：<https://ghfast.top/https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.2.2/nvm-setup.zip>

Or：<https://nvm.uihtm.com/nvm-1.2.2-setup.zip>

**Set the mirror after installation**：

```powershell
nvm node_mirror https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/node/
nvm npm_mirror https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/npm/
```

**Common commands**：

```bash
nvm install 24.13.0  # Install a specific version
nvm use 24.13.0      # Use a specific version
nvm list             # View installed versions
```

::: details 🔄 Click to try it: Node Version Manager
Try switching between different Node.js versions:

<NodeVersionManager />

> 💡 **Practice**: Click different versions to switch and observe how the current version changes.
>
> 🎯 **Core concept**: nvm lets you manage multiple Node.js versions on the same computer.

## FAQ {#faq}

### Q: Ran into an error during installation?

Copy the error message and give it to an AI assistant. It will help you solve it.

### Q: Do I have to use GLM?

No. Claude Code uses Anthropic's official Claude models by default, but accessing them from mainland China requires a relay service. GLM is a highly cost-effective alternative, and you can also configure other domestic models such as Minimax, Doubao, and Qwen.



### Q: I already installed Node.js separately. Can I still install nvm?

Yes. nvm manages its own separate Node.js versions and won't affect the version you previously installed. After installing nvm, you can use `nvm use` to switch versions or `nvm install` to install new ones.
